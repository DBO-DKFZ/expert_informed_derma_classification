# Expert-informed dermatoscopic classification for melanoma detection

This repository provides code to test, train, and tune a multi-classification networks for dermatoscopic RGB image analysis, and accompanies the paper:

Expert-informed melanoma classification with dermoscopic and histopathologic data: Results and recommendations for practice, Haggenm√ºller, S.; Heinlein, L.; Abels, J.; et al., Conference/Journal TBD, 2025

This Git repository provides only the model weights corresponding to the approach described in the paper, which incorporates a preprocessing step that darkens the lesion.
